# Um...hi.

This is a work in progress.  No, really: it's pretty much useless at the
moment.  It will be evolving alongside
[goauth](http://github.com/alloy-d/goauth) and 9t (currently even less
complete; link soon).


It currently has a whopping three functions:

## `Status()`

Returns your status.


## `Update(string)`

Updates your status.


## `User(string)`

Gets information about a user (used by `Status()`).
